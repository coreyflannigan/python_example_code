Small examples of my code in Python

SIN-UPC-ISBN-Validator.py

     Small file I wrote in order to validate SINs, UPCs, and ISBNs, either complete numbers or with an optional missing digit, created 
during the SIN-UPC-ISBN module of my Discrete Math & Statistics course.

compsciSquares.py

     Tic Tac Toe game mixed with Rock Paper Scissors I wrote for the term project in my Programming Fundamentals course. Relies heavily 
on if-elif-else blocks rather than looping and array structures as it was written early in my program at College.
